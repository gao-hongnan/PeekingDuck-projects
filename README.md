## Introduction

> PeekingDuck is an open-source, modular framework in Python, built for Computer Vision (CV) inference. The name "PeekingDuck" is a play on: "Peeking" in a nod to CV; and "Duck" in duck typing. - Extracted from [PeekingDuck](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck).

We will use the PeekingDuck framework to create two use cases:

- **Exercise Counter**: we will create custom node(s) using PeekingDuck Framework to count the number of times a user has performed a push-up. The example can be extended to other exercises such as sit-ups, pull-ups and other general exercises by altering the **counting logic**.
- **Melanoma Prediction with Grad-CAM**: we will create a custom node using PeekingDuck Framework to predict the presence of melanoma in an image and output the image with the Grad-CAM highlighted.
